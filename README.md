# LDI-TOF-MS
The presented R workflow has been developed for the analysis of mass spectra of inorganic materials. The main goal is to create a script that will be able to automatically identify overlapping complex isotope distributions in mass spectra. This will primarily be done by estimating possible stoichiometries based on the assumed elemental composition of the material and possible impurities. Generate model distributions of the predicted stoichiometries. Calculate the percentage of each cluster that fits the experimental data and the final fit to these data. 
In addition, the workflow presented includes a number of additional features such as batch processing of mass spectra, pre-processing and alignment of spectra. Functions for calculating Kendrick mass, comparing the number of identified signals from experimental data with individual models, and the ability to detect isobaric interferences in ICP-MS.
# DATA
Data from an LDI-TOF MS analysis of an elemental mixture of gallium and selenium were used as example data to demonstrate the proposed R script. The dataset contains 5 exported mass spectra in text format (.txt) together with metadata. In addition, the exported mass spectra are used in Excel format (.xlsx). The data were acquired on an Axima Resonance quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, Manchester, UK).
